ocaml-example-scripts
=====================

Some OCaml scripts for learning/understanding the language. Finding online 
resources and narrative documentation for ocaml libraries is a bit hard, 
so I made this repository to have every script I've learned from and every 
script I've made in one place, as well as to keep my sources organized and
accredited.

Installing OCaml and used libraries in a fairly recent Ubuntu:
--------------------------------------------------------------

* `apt install ocaml opam`
* `opam install merlin ocamlbuild core csv oUnit angstrom opium`

Recommended reading:
--------------------

_Note: Keep in mind that F# originated as an implementation of ocaml, so 
there are a lot of similarities._
