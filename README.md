ocaml-example-scripts
=====================

Some OCaml scripts for learning/understanding. Finding online resources and
narrative documentation for ocaml libraries is a bit hard, so I made this
repository to have every script I've learned from in one place. Source is
accredited on comments at the top of each file.

Installing OCaml and used libraries in a fairly recent Ubuntu:
--------------------------------------------------------------

* `apt install ocaml opam`
* `opam install merlin ocamlbuild core csv oUnit angstrom opium`

_Note: Keep in mind that F# originated as an implementation of ocaml, so 
there are a lot of similarities._
